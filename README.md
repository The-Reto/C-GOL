# CCA
"CCA" or "Cryptographic Cellular Automaton" is an exploration of a - most likely stupid - Idea I had a while ago.
The idea was to use the chaotic behaviour* of celular automata under certain rule sets for applications such as RNG, Hashing and even encryption. 

*:_Is it actually chaotic? I haven't checked, but it looks pretty chaotic to the naked eye, doesn't it?_

I am of course not claiming that this is viable - in all likelihood it isn't.

I haven't done proper analysis of the RNG to quatify its' properties*, nor have I spend any time checking whether my idea for hashing actually produces decent results. Much less would I recommend anyone actually using this little encryption scheme for anything important.

This is purely a little exercise for me to keep coding in my free time.

*: I did however run the DIEHARDER test suite on my generator and the current implementation passes most tests therein (will publish results at some point in the future).
